# MSC-NeuralComputing

Main inspiration and mentorship that came from Sentdex; which is YouTube channel by **Harrison Kinsley** for Python Programming Harrison also runs a website http://pythonprogramming.net which has many pf Python programming tutorials on Basics Fundamentals, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Robotics, Web Development, Game Development, GUI etc. 

The main source for this is https://nnfs.io , and I reccomend for a deep understanding of how neural networks work.
